days = ("Mon", "Tue", "Wed")

Days don’t change → tuple is best ✔

Why tuples exist?

Tuples are used when:

Data should not change

You want safety

Faster than lists

 Immutability (MOST IMPORTANT)
 
data = (10, 20, 30)
data[1] = 50 
This will give ERROR 

Why?

Because:

Tuple values cannot be modified after creation
